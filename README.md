# Nodejs-Express-js-and-React-Native-Bet-App-Mysql-Database

This project essentially presents the most popular betting options within the country in a simple list format to the user.
On the backend side, an API has been developed using Express.js. 
Initially, the data is scraped from the most popular betting website using Selenium and then stored in a MySQL database. 
The data stored in MySQL is directed to specific URLs. The data from these URLs is fetched using Axios in React Native and used in the project.
This project utilizes Node.js, Express.js, React Native, MySQL, Selenium Web Driver, Axios, and other libraries. 
Users will be able to view detailed information on the most popular betting options in both football and basketball in the country.
